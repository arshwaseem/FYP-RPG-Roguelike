WEAPONS & ARMOR PACKS
www.InfinityPBR.com

Thanks for purchasing a Weapon & Armor Pack!

Please note: The pack is set up to merge with all the other Weapons & Armor Packs, so they're nicely organized if you have more than one. If you find an empty folder of a type of weapon or armor, it's likely that those objects come from another one of the packs.

Don't forget to download the Substance Painter source files from the asset store (free Bonus packs) so you can customize your own textures!
