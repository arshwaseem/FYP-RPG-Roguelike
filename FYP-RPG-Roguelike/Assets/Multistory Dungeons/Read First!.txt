Which version to choose?

The pack contains SRP and Standard versions for Desktop and Mobile platforms.

For standard workflow:

1) Check your color space settings under Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Other Settings.

2) Pick a version that matches your platform and color space.

For example, if you are developing a PC project and your color space is Linear, then
Multistory Dungeons PC Linear 1.7.unitypackage is for you.

3) Double Click on a pack to import its contents.
Or go to Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package and select the one you want to import.

For SRP:

1) These should always be in linear color space (Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Other Settings)

2) HDRP is for desktop platforms and LWRP is for mobile.

3) We recommend starting the project from an SRP template, but if you started form a blank project,
or decided to upgrade to SRP, you would need to install High Definition RP or Lightweight RP from
package manager (Window -> Package Manager), then create and assign a RenderPipelineAsset to a
corresponding field under Edit -> Project Settings -> Graphics. You can find pre-made RenderPipelineAssets
in Multistory Dungeons 2 -> Settings.

4) Double Click on a pack to import its contents.
Or go to Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package and select the one you want to import.

OBSOLETE folder contains previous versions with scale problems, please don't use them for new
projects, they are only kept for compatibility.

===================

Please make sure to backup your project before updating to a new version, otherwise
you might lose some of your progress!

Note that every new level in mobile-gamma version is going to look a bit dark before the
lighting is baked because GI is calculated in Linear color space.

The pack is set up to work with lightmap resolution of 8 and above, but it is possible
to set it to 5 and still get acceptable results especially on mobile platforms.
